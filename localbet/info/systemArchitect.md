### System Architecture:

1. **Frontend:**
   - Utilize Next.js for the web platform and React Native for Android and iOS.
   - Implement responsive design to ensure a seamless user experience across devices.

2. **Backend:**
   - Use a Node.js backend with Express or Nest.js for handling server-side logic.
   - Incorporate a GraphQL API to efficiently fetch and update data between the frontend and backend.
   - Implement token-based authentication for secure user access.

3. **Database:**
   - Choose a relational database like PostgreSQL for structured data storage.
   - Design a schema that supports user accounts, teams, games, and betting information.
   - Consider a separate database for logging and analytics.

4. **User Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Implement a secure authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
   - Define user roles (super-admin, team admin, region game organizer) with appropriate access permissions.

5. **Registration and Profile Management:**
   - Allow local game organizers to register their teams and games through a user-friendly portal.
   - Implement user profiles with the ability to manage team information, game schedules, and betting preferences.

6. **Betting Engine:**
   - Develop a robust betting engine that supports both local and international games.
   - Integrate real-time odds generation and updates.
   - Implement secure payment gateways for handling betting transactions.

7. **Admin Panel:**
   - Create a super-admin portal for managing overall system settings, user roles, and access controls.
   - Provide team admins with a dedicated portal for team management, game scheduling, and reviewing betting activities.

8. **Notification System:**
   - Implement a notification system to keep users informed about game updates, results, and betting outcomes.
   - Utilize push notifications for mobile users.

9. **Security Measures:**
   - Implement HTTPS for secure communication.
   - Regularly perform security audits and vulnerability assessments.

10. **Internationalization and Localization:**
    - Design the system to support multiple languages and currencies for international users.

11. **Scalability and Performance:**
    - Use load balancing and caching mechanisms for improved performance.
    - Design the system architecture to scale horizontally as user traffic increases.

12. **Testing and Deployment:**
    - Implement automated testing for both frontend and backend components.
    - Use continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for efficient code deployment.
